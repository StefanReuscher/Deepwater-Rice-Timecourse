# Deepwater-Rice-Timecourse
Visualize Deepwater Rice RNAseq data

This repository holds a shiny-app that allows visualization and exploration of timecourse RNAseq data. The data is from http://www.plantphysiol.org/content/176/4/3081
but has since then been reanalyzed using our in-house C9285 reference genome.

A live example can be found at http://133.6.22.12/visualize-and-analyze-dwr-rnaseq-data/
